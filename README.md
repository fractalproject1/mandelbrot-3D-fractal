# mandelbrot_3D_fractal

This program was created with the intention of representing a 3-dimensionl version of the Mandelbrot fractal that I initially created in JavaScript. We can execute or visualize this Python code translation in a 3D software like Blender thanks to the <i>text-editor</i> property.

I decided to also add the JavaScript file â€“ please, feel free to use any of my code!
